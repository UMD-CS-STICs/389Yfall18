# Lane Line Fitting
![](https://i.imgur.com/ib49I1e.jpg)

In this project you will be fitting a polynomial model to each lane line on a road and then use those models to estimate the car's position on the road. You will complete the project in two parts. The first helps guide you through the process of building the pipeline on a single frame while the second applies your pipeline to an entire video. Both parts will be due Friday, September 28th at 11:59pm. You will submit the project by emailing me a zip file. 

## Part One: Develop the Pipeline
Use the file `Pipeline Tester.ipynb` to develop your pipeline. I've outlined the general steps that your pipeline should include and wrote some visualization code that you might find helpful. However, you are in no way locked into the pipeline I have outlined. Feel free to modify the pipeline in any way you choose so long as the only libraries you use are numpy and opencv. Also feel free to ask for help writting visualization code in piazza if the code already provided is not sufficient to your needs. A completed part 1 should be a pipeline that takes a raw 3 channel image of a road, produces a polynomial model for each lane line, uses those models to estimate the car's position on the road (more information on this in the jupyter notebook), and visualizes the result (like in the image above).

## Part Two: Realtime Video and Write Up
Part two to be released later in the week
